# cybermonday-test-app
A test application for the [cybermonday](https://github.com/kiranshila/cybermonday) markdown to hiccup parser.

The side by side rendering is customized to render with the excellent [Dracula UI](https://draculatheme.com/ui) components, [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for code blocks, and [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) for math.
Other than that, the markdown is rendered with the default lowering options.
